## Welcome to the pimpMyBee documentation!

An attempt to devellop custom firmware for xiaomi Zigbee devices.

## Foreword

Be warned: This is a work in progress.
At this stage, there is no stepping back: if you decide to flash you device with a custom firmware, you won't be able to revert to the factory firmware. The device will not be usable anymore with the Xiaomi Gateway.

## Welcome to the pimpMyBee documentation!

An attempt to devellop custom firmware for xiaomi Zigbee devices.

## Foreword

Be warned: This is a work in progress.
At this stage, there is no stepping back: if you decide to flash you device with a custom firmware, you won't be able to revert to the factory firmware. The device will not be usable anymore with the Xiaomi Gateway.

### Getting started
* [Get access to the programming port - WORK IN PROGRESS](hardware.md)
* [Install the required software - TO BE COMPLETED]
* [How to flash a firmware - TO BE COMPLETED]

### Customs firmware
* [License] (../LICENSE.md)
* [Use your xiaomi devices as a zigbee sniffer (By Jerome-PS)] (https://github.com/Jerome-PS/JN516xSniffer)
* [Use your Xiomi gateway as a zigbee router (repeater) - NOT WORKING YET]
